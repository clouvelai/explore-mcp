Reflects what the tool would actually return\n2. Is appropriate for the tool's purpose based on its name and description\n3. Includes realistic data (not just \"mock_value\")\n4. Handles mathematical operations with actual calculations when possible\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object mapping tool names to mock response strings. No other text.\n\nExample format:\n{{\n  \"tool_name\": \"realistic response string\",\n  \"another_tool\": \"another realistic response\"\n}}",
