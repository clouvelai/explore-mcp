# NPM Package Integration Plan

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - MVP implemented  
**Implementation**: Simple, explicit npm package support

## Summary

Completed npm package integration allowing direct installation and management of published MCP servers through explicit `--source npm` flag.

## Implementation

✅ **Core Features Completed:**
- `--source npm` explicit package installation
- Binary detection and PATH resolution  
- Package version tracking from npm registry
- Convergent design - npm packages work like local servers after installation
- Clean integration with existing discovery/generation pipeline

## Example Usage

```bash
# Install npm MCP package (explicit --source npm required)
./mcp add fs @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem --source npm --category "Storage"

# Standard workflow after installation
./mcp discover fs
./mcp generate fs  
./mcp test fs
```

## Technical Details

**Key Integration Points:**
- Extended `ServerSource` model with npm fields (package_name, package_version, binary_path)
- Added npm installation logic to `ServerManager` 
- Updated CLI to support `--source npm` flag
- Leverages existing discovery/generation pipeline

**Architecture Benefits:**
- Simple explicit approach (no auto-detection complexity)
- Convergent design - npm packages work like local servers after installation
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reliable package version tracking
